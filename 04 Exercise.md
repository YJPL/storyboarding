## Exercise

### The assignment

Create a short one-minute silent film to familiarise yourself with the camera, sets, production, etc. For this one-minute film, think of a situation in which someone chases or follows a character. No dialogue, so you get to use visuals-only (in addition to sound and music) to convey your story.

You can use a storyboard for this exercise, although it's not mandatory.
