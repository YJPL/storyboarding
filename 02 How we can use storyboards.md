## Some ways to use storyboards in film production

Productions use storyboards to plan complex sets, or sequences, whenever there is SFX or VFX involved. It's excellent to plan and control a movie's budget. That said, I always found storyboarding equally useful as a conceptual and writing tool.

Storyboarding is one of the easiest and natural techniques to visualize a film before filming. 

There are many use cases for storyboards in film:

- [ ] Planning / Budget tool
- [ ] Timesaver!
- [ ] Visual screenplay
	- [ ] A blueprint for pre-production 
	- [ ] Prepare your sets 
	- [ ] Tell the story shot by shot
	- [ ] Editing tool (or pre-editing tool)
- [ ] As a pitching device to help fund your movie
- [ ] As a business tool 
	- [ ] Visualizing, explaining, selling, forecasting, etc. 

In filmmaking, a storyboard is a visual storytelling tool that allows us to see a sequence or the whole film in continuity.

You can use it to budget, prepare the shooting and communicate with a film crew.

I'd argue we can also use it as a creative tool instead or alongside writing, even at the early stage of creation.

- [x] Cinema is a visual medium 
- [x] Drawing is a cheap, simple, and natural way to tell stories in visual form
- [x] A storyboard gives you an overview of the whole story or sequence. You can "edit" your movie before shooting

It's economical and fun because you get to create, revise or re-create your screenplay with the simplest means.

### Verbal versus Visual
A film often starts with an idea, a synopsis that then translates into a screenplay. Drawing is complementary to writing. Both help us to think and play with ideas. The end goal is a film, a collective effort, so both can be complementary tools. One needs not to supersede the other.

There is also a strong relation between film and painting, the atmosphere, the composition, the staging, the lighting. All this can start with sketches.
