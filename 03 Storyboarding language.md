*movement, layout, framing and composition, lighting, and any useful technical indication to prepare your set*


In essence, we are working with the cinematic language and constraints of the frame. 

- [x] Film ratio
- [x] Shot size

### Constraints/Limitations VS creative control & freedom

Storyboards are a means to an end.

The final product is your film. Your storyboard is like your screenplay, a working device. Unlike screenwriting, storyboarding has no standard format.  You can create a style of your own and have fun.

***

- Be economical/efficient: storyboarding is about telling a story with as few lines as possible. 

- Simple drawings, stick figures, and outlined planes can be enough to describe your shots.

- Use small drawings, move quickly on fleshing out the story.

- Use visual memory. A storyboard artist is not a writer â€” he is more of a rememberer.

- Make everything work in black and white first, with emphasis on readability.

- Staging. You need to understand how staging works to operate from a position of choice.

- Acting. Understanding acting is especially important for animation because its goal is to recreate the illusion of life through movement. In live-action, conveying emotions is the actor's job, not the storyboard's primary concern. Storyboarding dialogues scenes with little action makes little sense unless the camera work is complex.

- You can use arrows for camera movement & action within the frame. 

> It takes a lot of effort to make things look effortless.
