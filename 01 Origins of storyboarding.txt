## Origins of storyboarding

Let's start with where it comes from, how you can use it in your project(s), then we can look at how the future of the field might look.

The origins of storyboarding, like many great, simple inventions, are not clear-cut.

Sequential storytelling began to emerge in the form of caricatures, cartoons and comics at the start of the twenty-first century.

The creation of the storyboard as a technique is sometimes attributed to **Georges Méliès**, illusionist, father of special effects, and one of the first film directors because he used sequential drawings to prepare his films. 

**Eisenstein** used sequential drawings to prepare his movies.

In the early days of the Disney studio, animator **Webb Smith** had the idea of drawing scenes on separate sheets of paper and pinning them up on a bulletin board to tell a story in sequence, thus creating the first storyboard as we know it today.
 
Disney popularized the technique and soon had story artists working alongside animators. The studios evolved with entire story departments in charge of developing the stories ahead of animating them.

The idea spread to other animation studios as well as live-action film productions.


During the 1940s, storyboarding became popular in live-action film productions and became a common medium to pre-visualize films.

**Alfred Hitchcock** used storyboards to prepare his sets but also as a marketing tool.

**Akira Kurosawa**, who was trained as a painter used paintings like mood boards to conceive the key scenes of his films.

**Jean-Pierre Jeunet** use storyboards and production drawings for his highly stylized films.

**Ridley Scott** extensively uses storyboards for all his movies. Formally trained as an illustrator, he did the storyboards for the first *Alien* movie himself.

**Hayao Miyazaki** uses storyboarding instead of writing a screenplay.

**Wes Anderson** uses storyboards for each of his films.

**Bong Joon-ho** storyboarded his entire *Parasite* movie (the storyboard is available as a graphic novel).

Storyboards are now an essential part of the creative process in filmmaking.
